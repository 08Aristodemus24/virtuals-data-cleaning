      "in kaidro: clan battles , players have the unique opportunity to pilot mechs termed spark suits . central to each spark suit is its spark chassis , categorized into three distinct types: light, medium, and heavy. each chassis type offers a unique set of base attributes, an identical configuration of equipment slots, and a distinct melee weapon: combat knife for light, sword for medium, and axe for heavy.\n",
      "players equip parts, known as spark modules , to these slots to customize their mech. each spark module contributes specific attributes to the spark suit, such as energy, defense, and attack power, enhancing the overall performance. moreover, players can further tailor their spark suits with a selection of ranged weapons, adding another layer of strategy and personalization to their combat approach.\n",
      "beyond attribute augmentation, some rare spark modules may grant the spark suit special abilities called arc functions . when equipped, these abilities become pivotal in battles, allowing players to spend the energy of their spark suit to unleash powerful maneuvers or attacks.\n",
      "the uniqueness of a spark module lies in its generation. attributes and functions of a module vary depending on its rarity, the player pilot level, and the specific type of module. as players ascend in pilot levels, they unlock the potential to obtain rarer parts from their amassed spark module collection. spark modules are generated from spark nodes that are collected through gameplay.\n",
