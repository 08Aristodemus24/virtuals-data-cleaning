read through this thread unfortunately there aren't any docks right now there is no live website I'm kind of basing everything I I understand off this thread but I think it's pretty cool and it's pretty interesting so I'll kind of swing over to the flowchart and explain to you how this thing works and you can you know follow Rings protocol and wait for some more in-depth information to do your uh research on it okay so let's swing over to the flowchart now okay so here we are on the flowchart we have dollar bill and we have rings protocol in the middle dollar bill has either some eth or some usdc uh whatever you choose to understand this with I'm going to use mostly eth but you'll get it um so what does he do he he deposits eth into the Rings protocol on mainnet eth okay so eth into eth and what it does is it will M him one to one eth s like the Rings protocol derivative of eth one: one via layer zero on Sonic okay now he can mint it on ethereum himself and then Bridge it himself or he can you say oh I want this stuff on Sonic and then there will they will batch it and and mint it up there for him him again there's some questions here like how how is he going to pay he he likely will pay for all of this gas in ethereum but there's the possibility that he might have to claim these on Sonic with a gas transaction on Sonic as well so anyhow so we have this system one to one one eth in one eth out on Sonic that's the ideal use case um so then moving on we have his brother his brother doesn't have very much money so he doesn't want to to deal with main net uh transactions so he can mint on Sonic and use in this case he's going to use usdc so he will mint like $100 in and get a hundred of these uh these uh Rings derivative of again one to one on on Phantom Sonic and then the protocol will will bring that usdc back down to main net in uh in batches as well now what happens with all these assets that are sitting on mayet well they are sent to these these uh what are they called the volts by this company called Verda or ver Vera volts okay so no vaita vaita volts so you'll have to look a little bit deeper into this protocol itself and find the risk factors of this but know that your assets are sent to this like Vault this yield farming vault which sends your assets into these other other protocols such as you know Unis swap a convex and such and such and such so you have to dig deeper to find out this protocol exactly where are your assets being sent and if you're comfortable with the risks of of this branch of this protocol of the Rings protocol so these assets are sent here to of course obtain yield on the main net uh assets okay so some of the things you can do with these ring assets obviously you can swap them up on Sonic if that's something you want to do you can hold like like a stable coin up there you know whatever you want to do up there but one of the options is you can stake them so if you stake them into some sort of staking contract then you get some der uh some staking derivative right and occasionally this uh protocol this these vaita Labs volts will obtain some more yield right and what the Rings protocol will do is it will take that yield it will mint more of those uh derivatives up here on on Sonic and give them some of them you know Pro roded to the people who are in this staking contract so if you're in the staking contract then you can you will can get some easy APR based on the risks of of this system and so forth moving on another option you can take those uh assets and you can lock them into like a V nft and obviously if there's a v nft there will be voting and bribing so all all the protocols up on Sonic they might uh bribe you to vote for uh for their specific protocol and you so you would vote on according to the bribes or whatever you feel or whatever you want and maybe you just are really bullish on one of these protocols so you vote on it regardless of bribes so you use your voting power to vote on them and obviously why would you do that so that they can obtain some of this yield so again the yield that's produced down here is bridged up right and then that yield some of it will be going to the stakers and some of it will be going ver via these voting positions to these uh protocols now what I really like about this is there's no governance token there's no locking of some token they've you know minted out of thin air it's all done with eth and usdc and all the yield is eth and usdc these are Sonic derivatives okay so that's pretty much it for today uh I you know obviously like I said this this protocol is like kind of beta or Alpha stage where you know there's not there's no docs to read but so you know do a little more due diligence dig deeper find out if this is something interesting to you and thank you for watching and goodbye\"],\n",

and sell stocks uh you can come here and go to search and you can see through all the stocks that they currently already have listed and you can kind of buy and sell these tokenized stocks um this this protocol is a little bit different than what we've seen in the past and I'm pretty interested in this because it is real world assets and it can bring a lot of people to to defy if they find this to be useful and this is a successful product so as you can see there are stocks uh there are some ETFs and so forth so you can come and check out the stocks in here see if anything's interested to you now of course they are also deployed on several chains uh as you can see now I'm not sure if all of the chains have uh the ability to actually mint these but I think some of them don't so you have to you can only mint on certain chains but you have access to the to to payment on on on many chains and so forth so as you can see there are quite a few chains even this Bitcoin uh root stock and and base and op and stuff like that and uh this thing was brought to me because uh they are considering to deploy on Iota actually they will deploy onota and they're considering to provide some liquidity on Velo meters so you might see some of the tokens from the system in the veloc meter with gauges and rewards and so forth so as always I have read through the docs uh the docs is a little bit lacking but it's not terrible it's a pretty quick read so I would suggest you to come and read through the docks yourself you know verify what I'm saying here make sure you understand it but I do have a flowchart for you to explain how this system works based on my understanding so let's swing over to the flowchart right now okay so here we are on the flowchart we have dollar bill he has some usdc or usdt depending on the chain and so forth or die but in this case he has usdc and he wants to buy some stocks so he goes to the sailing protocol okay so he buys some stocks so he he puts the usdc into the sailing protocol and he mints some stocks right so in this case he minted Apple stocks tokenized Apple stocks now what makes this special is all the accounting is being done on the blockchain there's no centralized server that needs to keep track of who's Who's got what and you know it's not a bank who who's you know you have to call them up and stuff everything happens on the Block chain it's instant it's transparent and it's immutable because everything is in the blockchain right so moving on so what happens next what does the protocol uh the sailing protocol do is they actually go and buy the stocks so this is something these are not derivatives these are not price feed tokens these are actual they they actually use the money to buy the stocks now I assume that they have a treasury of a bunch of capital to kind of preo things and to kind of fun things that are going to happen and you'll see in the case why this is probably a must okay so first of all uh let's say dollar bill comes at like you know 3 in the morning and the stock exchange is closed right so how they he he can still mint it's instant it's 247 7 days a week because it's blockchain so he can mint his Apple stock so but what the sailing protocol will do is it will wait until opening clock and then immediately buy the stock that is needed so in this case it will actually go and buy that Apple stock when the uh the time opens now they do have access to the institutional ex extended hour so they can be the first one to buy or or so forth there might be a little bit of risk in there and they might be managing that risk like a little bit but know that they have access to extended hours so they can buy and sell before uh the the retail and the uh the normal uh users can do so in that Stock Exchange but dollar bill has access to this 247 he can he can buy some stocks he can mint them and he can redeem them back to usdc now the other option the other possibility here is he can buy partial stocks so let's say Apple stock is worth I don't know let's say $200 right now um I'm not sure what it's worth but maybe something like that so it's $200 but let's say he only has 100 usdc so he will put 100 usdc into the protocol and he will get minted 0.5 tokens of Apple stock and what the sailing protocol will do is it will actually still buy a whole Pro a whole stock and hold the like and be ready when someone else comes along to buy the other half so you can buy partials and you can sell partials and they will just kind of cover the rest that is needed to to to actually trade on the stock exchange in full stocks right uh moving on uh some of these stocks do give dividends and uh the dividends here are quite good because they can they can give them to People based on the the the token Holdings so because it's on the blockchain it's transparent they they it's easy for them to access who do they owe dividends to and then dollar bill will just have to go and claim his dividends once in a while now these dividends can also be like uh claimable to do by dollar bill if he has put his stock into his tokenized stock into some sort of smart contct contract so they can check the smart contract and be like Oh dollar bill is the owner of two of those stocks we should give him two stocks worth of dividends right so here we will go and claim those uh moving on there is a token this is a D5 protocol and most D5 protocols have a token so this protocol does have a token of itself as well now the token does several things now first of all is it reduces the fees and stuff that the protocol takes so the first fee it does is it reduces the minting fee from 0 point uh 0.01 to 0.04 so the more you hold the less fees you will pay to Mint uh stocks right so there's a chart inside the docks you can go and check that chart and you can see all those fees the chart fees of how many of these tokens you need to hold in order to get to the the lowest tier of those fees the other thing is they take a performance fee on the dividends they keep some of those dividends so if you have a dividend stock it's probably a good idea to hold some of these sale tokens to reduce the fees that they are taking from your dividends so to give you the full share of your of your dividends okay or almost the full share so from 1 to 20% is what they take so that's the first uh kind of use case for this sale token is to reduce these fees moving on uh they they talk about asset uh listing um if you if grandma wants to list her asset uh on on she has some business or something she wants to list her asset on the protocol then she has to bond some sale tokens and based on the things she does if she does some malous stuff her bond will be slashed she will lose her sale tokens and so forth now this is something that she would have to reach out to them to do it's not something that's permissionless you know she would have to they would probably get her to do some kyc do some DD on her and so forth and uh it doesn't Clearly say whether or not you know it's going to be an IPO or not whether they're actually going to going to help her to put her her her business on the actual Stock Exchange or whether or not it's just kind of like a quasy tokenized version of this so that's something if you are Gramma and you want to know then you can dig deeper you can go ask them and find out more about that uh moving on something you can do with the tokenized asset or the tokenized stock is you can go to Unis Swap and you can sell it okay so maybe the the trading fee is better on Unis swof to sell it or or whatever you or whatever the case may be and as I mentioned they might be gauges on Velo meter where you can Farm APR with that now as I said before if the Dividends are able to look at smart contracts and you're providing liquidity then you're getting APR and you're probably going to be able to get your dividends as well again wait for that to be live ask questions find out if if that's actually the case when you want to do that or not um the last case we have for this token is uh the Arbitrage Bots now I mentioned before that this doesn't use oracles it doesn't use price feeds uh there has to be some price feed in inside the protocol that knows like how much Apple stock works but the the price of the token inside the market and inside here is not affected by it's affected by Arbitrage Bots right so the Arbitrage bot can kind of look at the the cost to Mint and the cost to sell on here and do an ARB between these LPS and the actual mint and redeem function on this so in order for him to be more competitive he's going to want to reduce his fees so he is going to hold more sale tokens in order to do that okay so that's pretty much it for today I hope this has been useful and interesting I find it to be pretty cool because it is bringing stocks back on chain it's been a long time since we've seen stocks on chain and they were always very synthetic and just derivatives these are actually stocks backed by stocks I did asked them a question about uh what happens if there's a hack or you know some problem you're saying this is backed how can I actually get my stock and they said you know there is a process where you can kyc dollar bill can kyc himself and then he can actually get those real stocks sent to him from the uh the broker because he actually you know they can take a snapshot of the blockchain it's transparent it's immutable it's there they can take a snapshot and be like oh this wallet is owned by a dollar bill uh dollar bill proves that and he can then redeem for those stocks uh those actual stocks so take a little I hope this is useful and interesting uh take some more looks as yourself and thank you so much for watching and goodbye\",\n",

unfortunately there are not any docks right now there is no live website i am kind of basing everything i i understand off this thread but i think it is pretty cool and it is pretty interesting so i will kind of swing over to the flowchart and explain to you how this thing works and you can you know follow rings protocol and wait for some more in depth information to do your uh research on it okay so let swing over to the flowchart now okay so here we are on the flowchart we have dollar bill and we have rings pr', 'otocol in the middle dollar bill has either some eth or some usdc uh whatever you choose to understand this with i am going to use mostly eth but you will get it um so what does he do he he deposits eth into the rings protocol on mainnet eth okay so eth into eth and what it does is it will m him one to one eth s like the rings protocol derivative of eth one one via layer zero on sonic okay now he can mint it on ethereum himself and then bridge it himself or he can you say oh i want this stuff on sonic and then there will they will batch it and and mint it up there for him him again there some questions here like how how is he going to pay he he likely will pay for all of this gas in ethereum', 'but there the possibility that he might have to claim these on sonic with a gas transaction on sonic as well so anyhow so we have this system one to one one eth in one eth out on sonic that is the ideal use case um so then moving on we have his brother his brother does not have very much money so he does not want to to deal with main net uh transactions so he can mint on sonic and use in this case he is going to use usdc so he will mint like in and get a hundred of these uh these uh rings derivative of again one to one on on phantom sonic and then the protocol will will bring that usdc back down to main net in uh in batches as well now what happens with all these assets that are sitting on', 'mayet well they are sent to these these uh what are they called the volts by this company called verda or ver vera volts okay so no vaita vaita volts so you will have to look a little bit deeper into this protocol itself and find the risk factors of this but know that your assets are sent to this like vault this yield farming vault which sends your assets into these other other protocols such as you know unis swap a convex and such and such and such so you have to dig deeper to find out this protocol exactly where are your assets being sent and if you are comfortable with the risks of of this branch of this protocol of the rings protocol so these assets are sent here to of course obtain yiel', 'd on the main net uh assets okay so some of the things you can do with these ring assets obviously you can swap them up on sonic if that is something you want to do you can hold like like a stable coin up there you know whatever you want to do up there but one of the options is you can stake them so if you stake them into some sort of staking contract then you get some der uh some staking derivative right and occasionally this uh protocol this these vaita labs volts will obtain some more yield right and what the rings protocol will do is it will take that yield it will mint more of those uh derivatives up here on on sonic and give them some of them you know pro roded to the people who are in', 'this staking contract so if you are in the staking contract then you can you will can get some easy apr based on the risks of of this system and so forth moving on another option you can take those uh assets and you can lock them into like a v nft and obviously if there a v nft there will be voting and bribing so all all the protocols up on sonic they might uh bribe you to vote for uh for their specific protocol and you so you would vote on according to the bribes or whatever you feel or whatever you want and maybe you just are really bullish on one of these protocols so you vote on it regardless of bribes so you use your voting power to vote on them and obviously why would you do that so t', 'hat they can obtain some of this yield so again the yield that is produced down here is bridged up right and then that yield some of it will be going to the stakers and some of it will be going ver via these voting positions to these uh protocols now what i really like about this is there no governance token there no locking of some token they have you know minted out of thin air it is all done with eth and usdc and all the yield is eth and usdc these are sonic derivatives okay so that is pretty much it for today uh i you know obviously like i said this this protocol is like kind of beta or alpha stage where you know there not there no docs to read but so you know do a little more due dilige', 'nce dig deeper find out

different than what we have seen in the past and i am pretty interested in this because it is real world assets and it can bring a lot of people to to defy if they find this to be useful and this is a

is transparent and it is immutable because everything is in the blockchain right so moving on so what happens next what does the protocol uh the sailing protocol do is they actually go and buy the

like you know in the morning and the stock exchange is closed right so how they he he can still mint it is instant it is days a week because it is blockchain so he can mint his apple stock so but what the sailing protocol will do is it will wait until opening clock and then immediately buy the stock that is needed so in this case it will ac', 'tually go and buy that apple stock when the uh the time opens now they do have access to the institutional ex extended hour so they can be the first one to buy or or so forth there might be a little bit of risk in there and they might be managing that risk like a little bit but know that they have access to extended hours so they can buy and sell before uh the the retail and the uh the normal uh users can do so in that stock exchange but dollar bill has access to this he can he can buy some stocks he can mint them and he can redeem them back to usdc now the other option the other possibility here is he can buy partial stocks so let say apple stock is worth i do not know let say right now um', 'i am not sure what it is worth but maybe something like that so it is but let say he only has usdc so he will put usdc into the protocol and he will get minted tokens of apple stock and what the sailing protocol will do is it will actually still buy a whole pro a whole stock and hold the like and be ready when someone else comes along to buy the other half so you can buy partials and you can sell partials and they will just kind of cover the rest that is needed to to to actually trade on the stock exchange in full stocks right uh moving on uh some of these stocks do give dividends and uh the dividends here are quite good because they can they can give them to people based on the the the toke', 'n holdings so because it is on the blockchain it is transparent they they it is easy for them to access who do they owe dividends to and then dollar bill will just have to go and claim his dividends once in a while now these dividends can also be like uh claimable to do by dollar bill if he has put his stock into his tokenized stock into some sort of smart contct contract so they can check the smart contract and be like oh dollar bill is the owner of two of those stocks we should give him two stocks worth of dividends right so here we will go and claim those uh moving on there is a token this is a d protocol and most d protocols have a token so this protocol does have a token of itself as we', 'll now the token does several things now first of all is it reduces the fees and stuff that the protocol takes so the first fee it does is it reduces the minting fee from point uh to so the more you hold the less fees you will pay to mint uh stocks right so there a chart inside the docks you can go and check that chart and you can see all those fees the chart fees of how many of these tokens you need to hold in order to get to the the lowest tier of those fees the other thing is they take a performance fee on the dividends they keep some of those dividends so if you have a dividend stock it is probably a good idea to hold some of these sale tokens to reduce the fees that they are taking from', 'your dividends so to give you the full share of your of your dividends okay or almost the full share so from to percent is what they take so that is the first uh kind of use case for this sale token is to reduce these fees moving on uh they they talk about asset uh listing um if you if grandma wants to list her asset uh on on she has some business or something she wants to list her asset on the protocol then she has to bond some sale tokens and based on the things she does if she does some malous stuff her bond will be slashed she will lose her sale tokens and so forth now this is something that she would have to reach out to them to do it is not something that is permissionless you know sh', 'e would have to they would probably get her to do some kyc do some dd on her and so forth and uh it does not clearly say whether or not you know it is going to be an ipo or not whether they are actually going to going to help her to put her her her business on the actual stock exchange or whether or not it is just kind of like a quasy tokenized version of this so that is something if you are gramma and you want to know then you can dig deeper you can go ask them and find out more about that uh moving on something you can do with the tokenized asset or the tokenized stock is you can go to unis swap and you can sell it okay so maybe the the trading fee is better on unis swof to sell it or or w', 'hatever you or whatever the case may be and as i mentioned they might be gauges on velo meter where you can farm apr with that now as i said before if the dividends are able to look at smart contracts and you are providing liquidity then you are getting apr and you are probably going to be able to get your dividends as well again wait for that to be live ask questions find out if if that is actually the case when you want to do that or not um the last case we have for this token is uh the arbitrage bots now i mentioned before that this does not use oracles it does not use price feeds uh there has to be some price feed in inside the protocol that knows like how much apple stock works but the', 'the price of the token inside the market and inside here is not affected by it is affected by arbitrage bots right so the arbitrage bot can kind of look at the the cost to mint and the cost to sell on here and do an arb between these lps and the actual mint and redeem function on this so in order for him to be more competitive he is going to want to reduce his fees so he is going to hold more sale tokens in order to do that okay so that is pretty much it for today i hope this has been useful and interesting i find it to be pretty cool because it is bringing stocks back on chain it is been a long time since we have seen stocks on chain and they were always very synthetic and just derivatives', 'these are actually stocks backed by stocks i did asked them a question about uh what happens if there a hack or you know some problem you are saying this is backed how can i actually get my stock and they said you know there is a process where you can kyc dollar bill can kyc himself and then he can actually get those real stocks sent to him from the uh the broker because he actually you know they can take a snapshot of the blockchain it is transparent it is immutable it is there they can take a snapshot and be like oh this wallet is owned by a dollar bill uh dollar bill proves that and he can then redeem for those stocks uh those actual stocks so take a little i hope this is useful and inter', 'esting uh take some more looks as yourself and thank you so much for watching and goodbye',
