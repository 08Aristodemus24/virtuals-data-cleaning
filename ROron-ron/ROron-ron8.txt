on our website, the level up merge feature will automatically calculate and display your merge success rate when you select your target ragmon and material ragmons. a detailed guide on how to use the level up merge will be provided in a separate article.
if you are a holder of an irochi ragmon, the level up merge may seem challenging since there are only a few irochi ragmons in our ragnarok monster world universe. however, do not be discouraged we are introducing another feature called ragmon upgrade. this new feature allows you to level up your ragmon without using the same type of ragmons as ingredients. we will explain this feature in another upcoming article.
stay tuned for more updates and get your ragmons ready for the exciting level up merge feature
