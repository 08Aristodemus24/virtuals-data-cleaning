We received limited but valuable information about the experience. It’s important to note it reflects the vision of Aavegotchi Native community member:\\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOKbJm8oLUzo-SgiYIY2rhwMOgb56AH9wiwL9AbYm0lG3SjA/viewform?usp=sf_link\\nAbout TheSandbox Team and community, we got tremendous returns. TheSandbox was shocked by the richness of Aavegotchi ecosystem and Lore applied in their voxeled environnement.\\nThis project scope of work Supported by the DAO was established as follow :\\n--\\n1) Creation of a Sandbox Single player experience providing :\\nEducational content about Aavegotchi\\nAavegotchi Lore exploration\\nCross universe Aavegotchi Artistic creation\\n2) Second: One Multiplayer experience\\nBêta test of TheSandbox 0.9 Gamemaker Version Multiplayer features\\nTo be delivered early 2024\\n3) Organization of incentives around the project\\n4) Aavegotchi x The Sandbox AMA\\nGFA decided to go further by achieving unscheduled/ out of scope milestones:\\nForge an official partnership between Aavegotchi and TheSandbox\\nBridge of gotchis as Official TheSandbox Aavegotchi Aavatar Collection\\nNegotiations to gain access to top tier (VIP) partner communication by TheSandbox on social media concerning the release\\nCreation of 3 full OG equipment sets (Sandbox Marketplace)\\nIRL event Hosted in TheSandbox Office in Paris\\nThe Enigma Odyssey (300+ contestants)\\nRIPPLES OF THE GOTCHIVERSE Graphic Novel (To be delivered soon)\\nEntrusted by the Licence IP signed with Aavegotchi, GFA community made the choice to lean over the revenue share repartition even if the initial proposal only mentioned 10% Royalty to Pixelcraft Studio.\\nDifferent types of revenues are generated through this project : Direct and indirect returns.\\nAbout Direct financial returns, here is the repartition GFA decided to apply :\\nSo far, around 13500 SAND tokens sales has been generated. DAO Share was delivered in December (7 425 SAND). Multiplayer Experience is empowered to generate more of those.\\nAbout Indirect revenues, please find below the stats of the single experience release engagement :\\n1) TheSandbox\\nSocial engagement\\nGood overall engagement on sandbox announcement tweets\\nGood visibility of Aavegotchi community to TheSandbox userbase\\nGood average in-game numbers (KYC Accounts)\\n2) Aavegotchi\\nSome of the best Aavegotchi tweets of 2023 (around 90k + views)\\nForge an alliance with top Web3 brend (TheSandbox)\\nWith the great impact this initiative had, it’s now official, as discussed during the last Hangout and AMA, Aavegotchi made the choice to get some lands (1 Estate 3x3) in TheSandbox. It Gives the possibility to Selfpublish Aavegotchi experiences beeing playable without interruption.\\nHere is the location of Aavegotchi 3x3 Estate owned by Pixelcraft :\\nhttps://www.sandbox.game/en/map/?lat=82&lng=-158&zoom=4&x=-158&y=82\\nProposal of Funding\\nThis proposal of funding is to empower GFA to operate Pixelcraft lands and partnership for a limited and renewable 6 months duration with as follows duties :\\nManagement of Project and Coordination\\nPartnership Management\\nMaintain channel of discussion with Sandbox officers like Sebastien Borget\\nUpgrades of Aavegotchi avatar collection in Sandbox\\nAavegotchi Assets collection utility and highlight in game\\nExperience Updates\\nManagement of Aavegotchi Parcels in Sandbox + Collect & analysis of InGame and Traffic datas with TheSandbox\\nUpgrades and modifications of experiences due to Sandbox New GameMaker and GameClient release (Forecasted Bi-Monthly for 0.9 minor versions) and specific events\\nInteraction in the Slack Technical support with Sandbox Team and ticketing system\\nOrganisation and Strategy for futur events\\nInGame contests / Social events\\nMaintain & highlight Aavegotchi in next mainstream Sandbox events like ie. alpha seasons / IRL events\\nPlease note the single player experience is beeing migrated as we speak to 0.9 version as covered in the initial DAO proposal.\\nThe overall budget breakdown to achieve those tasks for the 6 months duration of this proposal is 29 460 DAI\\nWe would suggest a monthly payment to be delivered each beginning of month.\\nThanks Frens for your attention and your support.'"
